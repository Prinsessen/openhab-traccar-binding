## 🐛 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Positions not updating as fast as expected

**Quick Check:**
1. Are you actually moving? (Check accelerometer in Status tab)
2. Is GPS fix acquired? (Check lat/lon in Status tab)
3. Is GPRS connected? (Check server connection status)

**Solution:** Review "Home on Moving" settings, verify Min Period = 3 sec

---

### Issue: Device not entering sleep mode

**Quick Check:**
1. Has it been 5 minutes since last movement?
2. Is ignition still ON? (Check voltage in Status tab)
3. Are you receiving SMS messages? (SMS prevents sleep)

**Solution:** Wait longer, verify voltage drops below 11.5V, check LED behavior

---

### Issue: Excessive battery drain

**Quick Check:**
1. Is sleep mode actually activating? (Check LEDs)
2. Is Bluetooth scanning when not needed?
3. Is Send Period too aggressive?

**Solution:** Verify sleep LED pattern, disable BT if not using beacons, consider Balanced config

---

### Issue: Configuration not saving

**Quick Check:**
1. Is device still connected?
2. Did you reboot after saving?
3. Is firmware up to date?

**Solution:** Reconnect, always reboot (firmware 04.00.00.Rev.13 is current)

## 🎬 Next Steps

1. **Read** the Configurator Settings Reference (file #2)
2. **Configure** your FMM920 following the step-by-step guide
3. **Test** in vehicle (1-minute drive, verify updates)
4. **Monitor** for 24 hours to ensure stable operation
5. **Optimize** if needed (consult Comparison doc for alternatives)

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:

1. **Update firmware first** before configuring (if not already on 03.25.14+)

2. **Save configuration to file** BEFORE and AFTER changes (backup is crucial)

3. **Test movement detection** by shaking device and watching LED behavior

4. **Monitor first 24 hours** closely - check Traccar for position frequency

5. **Enable BLE beacons only if needed** - significant power savings if disabled

6. **Consider seasonal profiles:**
   - Summer (daily use): This "Fast" configuration
   - Winter storage: Switch to "Eco" configuration with Deep Sleep

7. **Use geofences** with email alerts instead of checking Traccar constantly

8. **Set up Traccar notifications** for critical events (speeding, geofence violations)

9. **Review server performance** - 100+ vehicles may need database optimization

10. **Keep this documentation accessible** - bookmark the location or print key pages
